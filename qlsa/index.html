              For most people who don't understand quantum computing, especially for investors and application
              developers, they always have a simple question that is never been answered clearly -- "How fast exactly
              is the quantum algorithm?", Please be frank, now if I run my task on a quantum computer, how long does
              it
              takes exactly? I don't want to hear any theoretical shit, damn, please just let me know how many hours
              does it
              take!
            </p>


            <p>
              The answer to this question lies in two aspects. One is
              where quantum is
              faster,
              which is the computational complexity, namely, quantum computer's cost would scale (often exponentially)
              slower with problem size.
              The other is where quantum computer is slower, which is quantum computer execute logical instructions many
              times
              longer than classical computer due to the physical limitation of current quantum technology. So consider
              both aspects the real runtime comparison for quantum and classical computer will look
              roughly
              like the following:
            </p>
            </p>
            <img src="assets/qlsascaling.png" alt="Quantum vs Classical Scaling"
              style="width: 80%; height: auto; margin: 24px 0;" />
            <p>
              The answer to the simple question "How long does it take" is all about this cross point, suppose the cross
              point is (1000, 100s), then I would say: "3 minutes", and you will keep asking "For what size?", then I
              would
              say
              "
              For whatever size, it's just roughly 3 minutes, I suggest that you consider using quantum computer if the
              problem size you are targeting is larger than 1000, because that's where quantum computer becomes faster"


            </p>

            <p>
              In this work we aim to answer this simple question by finding the critical cross point for "Quantum linear
              system of Equations algorithm"
              (QLSA),
              which proven to solve linear system of equations in the quantum world exponentially faster than classical.
              Because
              linear
              system of equations is the most important computational problem, QLSA received significant attention and
              has been
              applied as a fundational algorithm in quantum machine learning and others.
            </p>

            <img src="assets/qlsaresult.png" alt="QLSA Result" style="width: 80%; height: auto; margin: 24px 0;" />
            <p>
              Our results shows that the critical cross point for QLSA is roughly (1e10, 3h), which means QLSA can
              solve quantum linear systems of equations in about 3 hours. And it's quicker than classical if the
              matrix size is larger than 1e10 x 1e10, which is huge. This means there is no benefit to use QLSA for
              most applications. However there is still a potential for QLSA to be useful in specific cases where the
              problem size is extremely large. Of course, this analysis does not account for all the caveats of QLSA
              algorithm (https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2196).
              Amoung which the most important thing to notice is the input output problem, which means user has to load
              data
              into the quantum computer, and also the solution is encoded into a quantum state and cannot be read
              directly.
              Thus our result should be taken as a best case scenario.
